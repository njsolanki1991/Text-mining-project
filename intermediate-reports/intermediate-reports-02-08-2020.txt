What has been done?
1. Running of Baseline codes in Jupyter Notebook and obtaining evaluation results on entire dataset
2. Cleaning of the git repository and adding comments

What will be done?
1. Selecting threshold values for all features by running dissimilarity measure on given training data
2. Running evaluation measures on our dissimilarity algorithm
3. Comparision of evaluation measures of two baseline methods and dissimilarity method and performance tuning 

Open questions?
1. Unable to run the jupyter notebook in the environment provided. Can you help running the environment ?
2. Do we have to divide the data set into training and test?
