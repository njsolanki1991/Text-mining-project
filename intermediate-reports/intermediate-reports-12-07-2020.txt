What has been done?
1. Explore different processing techniques of given dataset using the packages learned in nltk chapters
2. Extracting features for different tasks to be used in the algorithm
3. Generation and modification algorithm based on Dissimilarity Measure
4. Modifying Baseline codes in Jupyter Notebook
What will be done?
1. Selecting threshold values for all features by running dissimilarity measure on given training data
2. Running of Baseline codes in Jupyter Notebook and obtaining evaluation results

Open questions?
1. Running of disimilarty algorithm on entire dataset is taking a lot of time. Is it possible to reduce dataset length from original PAN20 dataset ?
2. We created milestone as a issue. What to do with it ?
